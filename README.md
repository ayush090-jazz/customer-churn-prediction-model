# customer-churn-prediction-model
Built a logistic regression model to predict customer churn. Data was cleaned, encoded, and used for training. The final model was saved using joblib as churn_model.pkl. Developed using Python and Jupyter Notebook. 
# Customer Churn Prediction using Machine Learning

This project uses a logistic regression model to predict customer churn in a telecom company.  
It includes interactive widgets (via `ipywidgets`) to input customer details and predict churn.

### ðŸ”§ Tools Used:
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn
- Jupyter Notebook / Google Colab
- ipywidgets
- Streamlit (optional)
- VoilÃ  (for web interface)

### ðŸ§  Features:
- Data preprocessing and EDA
- Model training with Logistic Regression
- Model serialization with joblib
- Interactive UI using `ipywidgets`
- Ready for deployment with VoilÃ  or Streamlit

### ðŸ“‚ Files Included:
- `churn_model.ipynb` â€“ notebook with UI and predictions
- `churn_model.pkl` â€“ trained model
- `README.md` â€“ this file

### ðŸ“Š Dataset:
Loan prediction dataset from Kaggle: [Link](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets)
